I was using noiton to organize my week and found the calendar Icon only showed July 17. And I find it confusing, so decided to generate an icon for each of the calendar dates. Free feel to fork this repo and create your own version. 
Original icon inspired from this link https://icon-sets.iconify.design/emojione/spiral-calendar/ . I removed the spiral binder and simplified by removing the rounded corners and shadows.
